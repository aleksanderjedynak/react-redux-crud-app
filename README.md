# React Redux CRUD App

This App implements common CRUD operations over the API.

## Setup

You have to setup the project first

* `yarn` will install all of the packages.
* `yarn start:api` will start the `json-server` which will load the `api/db.json`
* `yarn start:dev` will start the `webpack-dev-server`

I spend about 5 hours to build this simple App. Choose to take more general approach in Redux for simplicity.

Also I'm open for all kind of changes so file an Issue or PR :)
